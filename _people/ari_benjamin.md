### Bio

I'm a PhD student in BME here at Northwestern. I just finished a master's at NU in molecular dynamics simulations and biomaterials (very different, I know). I graduated from Williams College in 2013 with a bachelor's in physics, and traveled to Mexico in 2014 to teach a year of high school chemistry.

### Research Interests

I'm interested in using machine learning techniques for a range of problems in neuroscience. Currently fascinated by information representation in the brain.
