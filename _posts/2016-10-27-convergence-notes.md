title:  "Some notes on the convergence of maximum likelihood functions"

We've all read the dreaded `convergence not achieved` message, punctuated by `r(430);`, after waiting for a long maximization process. These situations are most commonly encountered when estimating logit, probit or any kind of maximum-likelihood model, but in general they arise whenever you're asking it to perform iterative maximization. In this post I'll share some practical advice on how to deal with slow or non-convergent maximization processes.

# A bit of intuition on maximum likelihood

You have some data and are willing (?) to assume that it is generated from some distribution. Say you assume it comes from a normal distribution. That's fine, but there are infinitely many possible parameters (i.e. means, variances) that "source" distribution may have.

#Â A bit of math

We know that the maximization problem is

$$ L(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}};\boldsymbol{Z}) = \max_{\boldsymbol{t}\in\Theta} L(\boldsymbol{t};\boldsymbol{Z}) $$

which simply means we are maximizing
