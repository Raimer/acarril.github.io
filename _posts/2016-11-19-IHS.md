As Chris Blattman explains in a [blog post](https://chrisblattman.com/2011/11/15/if-you-know-what-ln1income-is-and-why-its-a-headache-you-should-read-this-post/), the main advantage of using an inverse hyperbolic sine transform instead of the typical log transform on the dependent variable is that the former is defined for any real number, including those annoying zeroes and (and sometimes negative values) that our trusty logarithm just can't handle. In this post I'll explore this alternative transformation in greater depth.

# The log transform

In a plain vanilla regression model like

$$
y = \alpha + \beta x + \epsilon
$$

one can choose to take the (natural) logarithm of the dependent and independent variables ($$y$$ and $$x$$). Notice that in that transformed model you'll have

$$
\beta = \frac{\partial \log{y}}{\partial \log{x}}
$$
