title: Use Atom!

Yes, I know than a year ago I wrote [a long post urging you to use Sublime](/posts/use-st3).
However, [times are a changin'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7qQ6_RV4VQ), _fast_ (at least for me), as I have matured my coding workflow very much.
So without further ado, let me bring forth to you the ultimate text editor:

In this guide I'll give a detailed explanation on how to set up Atom for use with (my) furious five:

- Python
- R
- Stata
- LaTeX
- Julia

# Installation and basic setup

Head over to [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/) to download Atom for your operating system, and then install it.
Upon first execution, you should be greeted with something like the following screenshot:

Now we're ready to go!

I suggest you open the Tree View (`View > Toggle Tree View`, or hit `Ctrl+\`), which gives you an overview of the files contained in a folder.
You can now right-click anywhere in that pane and select `Add Project Folder` (or hit `Ctrl+Shift+A`) to open any project folder that contains some scripts (eg. `*.py` files).
After doing so you should see something like the following screenshot:

You'll notice that my file icons in the Tree View probably look much nicer than yours.
It's not only that their nice --- it's helpful to be able to tell file types apart at a glance.
We'll fix that now, installing two packages (that I consider) essential:

- [File Icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons)
- [Project Manager](https://atom.io/packages/project-manager)

To install any package in Atom just go to `File > Settings` (or hit `Ctrl+Comma`) and select `Install` on the left pane (you can also go directly from the welcome screen, if you have it open).
Search for `file-icons` and install it.
If you had a project folder open in the Tree Viewer, you should immediately see icons being updated.

Repeat the process above, this time looking up `project-manager`.
