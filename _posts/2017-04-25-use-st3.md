title: Use Sublime!

Seriously, switching to Sublime has been the single biggest productivity booster in years. First, take a look at how gorgeous it ~~is~~ can be:

Sublime Text is a cross-platform source code editor. You can easily add multiple plugins to extend its functionality, making it possible to edit and compile Stata code, Python scripts, R, LaTeX, Julia... the list is endless. You can also customize several other aspects like multiple-column layout or keyboard shortcuts, to name a few.

You may be wondering what's so special about running a Python script and compiling a LaTeX document from the same editor, since you may already use a Python IDE like PyCharms and a perfectly fine LaTeX editor like Texmaker. Thing is, large projects are usually complex and require handling a wide variety of files, so having a lightweight, customizable editor that can handle all of them makes it easier to both stay on top of the big picture and quickly dive into any kind of code for additional work.
