Seriously, switching to Sublime has been the single biggest productivity booster in years. First, take a look at how gorgeous it ~~is~~ can be:

## What is it?

[**Sublime Text**](https://www.sublimetext.com) is a free cross-platform source code editor. You can easily add multiple plugins to extend its functionality, making it possible to edit and compile Stata code, Python scripts, R, LaTeX, Julia... the list is endless. You can also customize several other aspects like multiple-column layout or keyboard shortcuts, to name a few.

You may be wondering what's so special about running a Python script and compiling a LaTeX document from the same editor, since you may already use a Python IDE like PyCharms and a perfectly fine LaTeX editor like Texmaker. Thing is, large projects are usually complex and require handling a wide variety of files, so having a lightweight, customizable editor that can handle all of them makes it easier to both stay on top of the big picture and quickly dive into any kind of code for additional work.

## I'm sold, how can I get Sublime up and running?

Just head to [sublimetext.com](https://www.sublimetext.com) and download Sublime 

## R

Getting R to work with ST3 is pretty easy. If you haven't already, go to the [R-project](https://www.r-project.org/) and install R.
Once you've done that, you need to add R to you environment path. First locate your installation folder, which in Windows is something like

```
C:\Program Files\R
```

Inside you should see a folder for every version of R you have in your system. Go into the latest one and locate the `bin\x64` or `bin\x32` folder, depending on which version of R you installed. For example, the full directory in my Windows system is

```
C:\Program Files\R\R-3.4.0\bin\x64
```

To add this path, right-click on My Computer and choose Properties > Advanced (System Settings) > Environment Variables. Edit the `Path` variable (User or System, your choice) and add a line with the path you just located above. Accept these changes and then fire up the command line, where you should be able to execute `R` now:

```
Alvaro@DESKTOP-3U3RLE3 C:\Users\Alvaro
> R

R version 3.4.0 (2017-04-21) -- "You Stupid Darkness"
Copyright (C) 2017 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)
...

>
```

Now you can run R scripts directly from within Sublime. To test it, create a new file with `.R` extension and write some R code. For example:

```R
seq(1,10)
```

In order to run this code with R you need to choose your **build system**: go to Tools > Build System and choose R. Now you can select Tools > Build (or just hit Ctrl+B) to run this code! You should see the output on the Console pane of ST, on the bottom of your screen.
