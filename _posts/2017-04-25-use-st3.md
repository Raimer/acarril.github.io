title: Use Sublime!

Seriously, switching to Sublime has been the single biggest productivity booster in years. First, take a look at how gorgeous it ~~is~~ can be:

Sublime Text is a cross-platform source code editor. You can easily add multiple plugins to extend its functionality, making it possible to edit and compile Stata code, Python scripts, R, LaTeX, Julia... the list is endless. You can also customize several other aspects like multiple-column layout or keyboard shortcuts, to name a few.

You may be wondering what's so special about running a Python script and compiling a LaTeX document from the same editor, since you may already use a Python IDE like PyCharms and a perfectly fine LaTeX editor like Texmaker. Thing is, large projects are usually complex and require handling a wide variety of files, so having a lightweight, customizable editor that can handle all of them makes it easier to both stay on top of the big picture and quickly dive into any kind of code for additional work.

# I'm sold, how can I get Sublime up and running?

## R

Getting R to work in ST3 is pretty easy. If you haven't already, go to the [R-project](https://www.r-project.org/) and install R.

Once that is done, you need to add R to you environment path. First locate your installation folder, which in Windows is something like

```
C:\Program Files\R
```

Inside you should see a folder for every version of R you have installed. Go into the latest one and locate the `bin\x64` or `bin\x32` folder, depending on which version of R you installed. For example, the full directory in my Windows system is

```
C:\Program Files\R\R-3.4.0\bin\x64
```

To add this path right-click on My Computer and choose Properties > Advanced (System Settings) > Environment Variables. Edit the `Path` variable (User or System, your choice) and add a line with the past you just located above. Accept these changes and then fire up the command line, where you should be able to execute `R` and fire it up:

```
