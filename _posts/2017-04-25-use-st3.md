Seriously, switching to Sublime has been the single biggest productivity booster in years. First, take a look at how gorgeous it ~~is~~ can be:

## What is it?

[**Sublime Text**](https://www.sublimetext.com) is a free, cross-platform source code editor. You can easily add multiple plugins to extend its functionality, making it possible to edit and compile Stata code, Python scripts, R, LaTeX, Julia... the list is endless. You can also customize several other aspects like multiple-column layout or keyboard shortcuts, just to name a couple of examples.

You may be wondering what's so special about running a Python script and compiling a LaTeX document from the same editor, since you may already use a Python IDE like PyCharms and a perfectly fine LaTeX editor like Texmaker. Thing is, large projects are usually complex and require handling a wide variety of files, so having *one* lightweight, customizable editor that can handle all of them makes it easier to both stay on top of the big picture and quickly dive into any kind of code for additional work.

## I'm sold, how can I get Sublime up and running?

Just head to [sublimetext.com](https://www.sublimetext.com) and download Sublime Text 3 (ST3) for your operating system. Once you've installed it, you'll definitely want to add **Package Control**, which lets you easily add and remove additional plugins. Just follow [these instructions](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) to install it.

Using package control can add several plugins that will let us use ST3 to edit and compile the following programs:

- [R](#r)
- [Python](#python)
- [Julia](#julia)
- [Stata](#stata)
- [LaTeX](#latex)

We can also use Package Control to add themes, syntax color schemes and other enhancements that will help make ST3 your ultimate coding editor.

### 32 or 64 bits?

Before you continue, it is important to be sure whether you have a 32 or 64 bit operating system. The answer will determine which version of software you should install: if you have 32 bits, then you *must* choose 32 bit versions. If you have a 64 bits OS, then you can choose either... but it usually makes more sense to go for 64 bits software as well.

In **Windows** you can find out your system type by right-clicking on "This PC" (or "My Computer", in older Windows) and selecting "Properties". Look for "System type", like in the screenshot below:

![Windows 10 - System properties](http://i.imgur.com/gXfqa9f.png)

On **OSX** (macOS?), select "About This Mac" from the Apple menu (<i class="fa fa-apple" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and you should see a pane like the one below:

# R

Getting R to work with ST3 is pretty easy. If you haven't already, go to the [R-project](https://www.r-project.org/) and install the appropriate version for your OS.
Once you've done that, you need to add R to you environment path. First locate your installation folder, which in Windows is something like

```
C:\Program Files\R
```

Inside you should see a folder for every version of R you have in your system. Go into the latest one and locate the `bin\x64` or `bin\x32` folder, depending on which version of R you installed. For example, the full directory in my Windows system is

```
C:\Program Files\R\R-3.4.0\bin\x64
```

To add this path, right-click on My Computer and choose Properties > Advanced (System Settings) > Environment Variables. Edit the `Path` variable (User or System, your choice) and add a line with the path you just located above. Accept these changes and then fire up the command line, where you should be able to execute R now:

```
Alvaro@DESKTOP-3U3RLE3 C:\Users\Alvaro
> R

R version 3.4.0 (2017-04-21) -- "You Stupid Darkness"
Copyright (C) 2017 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)
...

>
```

Now you can run R scripts directly from within Sublime. To test it, create a new file with `.R` extension and write some R code, for example,

```R
seq(1,10)
```

In order to run this simple script with R you need to choose your **build system**: go to Tools > Build System and choose R. Now you can select Tools > Build (or just hit Ctrl+B) to run this code! You should see the output on the Console pane of ST, on the bottom of your screen.

# Python

Setting up a Python developing environment in ST3 is very easy, and the process is similar to R. First you'll need to install Python in your machine. For data science, I recommend getting the [Anaconda Python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).


### Python 2.7 or 3.X?

Whether to use Python 2 or 3 is still a hotly debated topic, as [a Google search will reveal](https://www.google.com/?gfe_rd=cr&gws_rd=cr#safe=off&q=python+2+vs+3). My recommendation is to take it easy, because (a) their syntax is fairly similar, (b) you can later switch and (c) the "typical" data science packages work for both versions. So I'd choose whatever version the book you're using or the colleague you're working with is using. If you have no reason to choose one or the other, then I'd probably go with Python 3, because that is the future, after all.


### Install Python

Download and install the appropriate version of Anaconda Python (the process is fairly straightforward). Once you're done, check that it is properly installed by firing up the Command prompt (Windows) or the Terminal (OSX) and just write down `python`. You should see the Python version and the Python shell ready:

```
Alvaro@DESKTOP-3U3RLE3 C:\Users\Alvaro
> python
Python 2.7.13 |Anaconda 4.3.0 (64-bit)| (default, Dec 19 2016, 13:29:36) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
Anaconda is brought to you by Continuum Analytics.
Please check out: http://continuum.io/thanks and https://anaconda.org
>>>
```

Cool! Now you can use it as a fancy calculator:

```python
>>> 3*2
6
```

Just type `quit()` to exit the Python shell.

### Run a Python script in ST

Sublime supports Python without any further configuration, so you can just create a new file ending with `.py` extension and write some Python code:

```python
import random

onetoten = range(10)
random.shuffle(onetoten)
print(onetoten)
```

You should be seeing the code with syntax highlighting, similar to the above code block. If you don't, make sure you see "Python" at the bottom right corner of your ST editor window.

Now, in order to build with Python just go to Tools > Build. The output should be visible in the Console pane of ST3, which is in the bottom. If you run into any issues, make sure to check whether Tools > Build System is set to "Python".


### Further enhancements

If you wish to turn ST into a fully featured Python IDE, then you should install the [Anaconda plugin](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Anaconda) (totally unrelated to the Anaconda Python distribution, btw). It enables autocompletion, code linting and a myriad of other fancy stuff.

To install it, just bring up the Command Palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type "install", hit `Enter` and search for "Anaconda". Just hit `Enter` again to install, and restart ST to see the changes.

# Stata

Getting [Stata](http://www.stata.com/) to work with ST3 requires a few steps, but it works very well when all is said and done. The process is quite different for [Windows](#windows) and [OSX](#osx), so I've split this tutorial in two sections. I'm assuming that you already have Stata up and running (these steps will work with all versions).

## Windows

There are two Stata plugins for ST in Windows: [StataEditor](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/StataEditor) and [Stata Enhanced](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Stata%20Enhanced). I tried both and finally preferred StataEditor, so that's the one we'll install and configure.

1. **Install StataEditor**: in ST3, start the command palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type "install" and hit `Enter`. Now search for StataEditor and just click on it to install.
2. **Install Pywin32**: repeat the process described above, now installing the Pywin32 plugin.
3. **Configure StataEditor**: In ST3 go to Preferences > Package Settings > Settings - User. In this blank file you need to write down the path to your Stata executable and the version. For example, my configuration file in Windows looks like this:

	```JSON
	{
		"stata_path": "C:/Program Files/Stata14/StataMP-64.exe",
		"stata_version": 14,
	}
	```
4. **Register Stata Automation library**: go to the Stata executable for which you copied the path (e.g. `StataMP-64.exe`) and create an shortcut for it. Now right click on this new shortcut and select "Properties". In the "Target" field, add `/Register` at the end (with a preceding space). For example:

	```
	"C:\Program Files\Stata14\StataMP-64.exe"  /Register
	```
Apply and accept those changes and now right click again on the shortcut and choose to "Run as administrator". Nothing is going to happen, but if you followed the instructions, it should be ready.

Restart ST3 and try opening an existing do-file (or creating a new one with `.do` extension). You should read "Stata" on the bottom right corner, and should be able to execute selections or complete do-files with `Ctrl+D`.


## OS X

# LaTeX

ST3 can be configured to work as a LaTeX editor pretty easily, specially if you've installed one of the "typical" TeX distributions: [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) or [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/). If you don't have LaTeX in your system, I suggest you get either TeX Live in Windows or MacTeX on OSX.

To install [LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools) simply open the command palette with `Ctrl+Shift+P`, type "install" and look for LaTeXTools. If when you type "install" you don't see "Package Control: Install Package", then you must [install Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) first.

That's it! You can now open any `.tex` file or create a new one, and compile it with `Ctrl+B`.
