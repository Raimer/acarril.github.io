title: How to use Git, Part 1
---

This is the number one question I get, so this post is an effort to write up a fairly comprehensive guide on understanding and incorporating Git and Github into your research workflow.
Part 1 (this post) will focus on the basics of Git.

# What are Git and GitHub?

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png" class="wrapped-float">

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a local version-control system for tracking and logging changes to plain-text files (source code).
Think of it as a series of annotated snapshots (*commits*) of all the code in a project.
Eventually you'll have a history of snapshots, and you can always come back to a previous one.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is arguably the most popular hosting service for Git-tracked projects (*repositories*).
It's a website in which you can publish your repositories privately or publicly, and collaborate with other people.

**In a nutshell, Git provides the tracking, and Github adds online backup and collaboration tools on top of that.**


# To CLI or not to CLI

As with many other programs, there are two ways of interacting with Git and GitHub: via a command line interface (CLI), or via a graphical user interface (GUI).
I won't rant too much about why you should prefer the command line interface over the graphical one, but here are a few arguments.

- **Learning:** GUI applications like GitHub Desktop abstract away their inner workings, so you'll be learning less Git.
Typed Git commands in the terminal read almost like English phrases, so they're easy to remember, and give a better sense of what you're doing.

- **Speed:** typing will quickly become _way faster_ than pointing and clicking in some silly interface.

- **Flexibility:** most GUIs only implement a partial subset of Git functionality, so soon enough you'll be constrained by it.

- **Ubiquity:** the Git CLI comes preinstalled by default in macOS and Linux, so if you're using or interacting with a machine that isn't your own, you'll immediately be familiar with the tools at your disposal.

- **Support:** when you run into errors (and oh boy, you will), it'll be much easier to look them up and solve them using the CLI, as the Git community favors that interface.

Hence, this guide will focus in the command line interface.
If you're unfamiliar with the command line, don't worry.
This guide doesn't assume you know how to use it, and I'll be explaining every step.

# Installing

Depending on your operating system, Git might be already installed for you.
It is very unlikely that that's the case in Windows, but you can search for "Git BASH" in your system.
To check in macOS or Linux, you can fire up a terminal and run
```bash
git --version
```
If you get something like `git version 2.22.0`, then you're good to go.
If not, it means Git is not installed.

To install in Windows or Mac, head over to [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/download/) to download the version that's appropriate for your system.
If you're on Linux I suggest you install it from your system's repository:
```bash
sudo apt install git // Ubuntu-based
sudo pacman -Sy git // Arch-based
```

After installing it, you should get the version when executing `git --version` on a terminal.
In Windows, you'll need to carry out all the commands in here using the Git BASH, which is a terminal-emulator application that comes with the installation.


### Basic setup

It is useful to declare a global username and email that will identify your changes.
You can do so by running these two commands:
```bash
git config --global user.name "acarril"
git config --global user.email "acarril@princeton.edu"
```
This is a one-time operation.

# Initializing a repository

A *repository* (cool kids just say "repo") is basically a folder where you have all the project files stored.
We'll go ahead and create a mock project folder to fiddle around.
<!-- We're going to be doing everything on the terminal.
In Windows, we'll use the Git BASH terminal emulator.
In Mac, you can just search for "Terminal" to fire up the default one.
Upon launching a terminal, it is useful to check where in the system are we.
This location usually is the user's "home" directory, which is  -->
In a terminal, run
```bash
mkdir myrepo
cd myrepo
```
This just creates an empty folder called `myrepo` in the current directory, and then changes directory to it.
Finally, we'll populate the directory with some plain text files.
You can do this using your favorite text editor, or directly from the command line:
```bash
printf "It was a pleasure to burn." >> farenheit.txt
printf "It's better to burnout\nthan to fade away." >> neil.txt
printf "first\nsecond\nthird" >> lines
```
You can check the contents of these files with the text editor of your choice (or using `cat <file>`).

We'll take this structure as our base project.
Now, in order to start tracking the changes in these files we need to *initialize* a Git repository with
```bash
git init
```

That's it! Now this directory (`myrepo`) is being tracked by Git, so it officially is a *repository*.
You can check the status of any repository by running
```bash
git status
```
You should get an output like the following:

# Adding files to keep track of

Although we have initialized a repository, we haven't specified which files we want to keep track of; that's why all of our files are "Untracked files" in the previous screenshot.
In order to start keeping track of files (or folders), we need to *add* them, which can be done with `git add <file or folder>`.
For example, we can add the `lines` file by running
```
git add lines
```

In a real project folder you will probably have more than two files, but there are ways to add files in bulk.
For example, we can easily add all the files with `.txt` extension by running
```bash
git add *.txt
```
This will add (track) `farenheit.txt` and `neil.txt`.
Finally, you can add all files and folders in the repo by using `git add .` or `git add -A` (you can read more about these [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572549/difference-between-git-add-a-and-git-add)).

Adding files is a one-time operation; once files are added, there's no need to add them again.

# Making commits

Once files are *added* (tracked), we can start logging their changes using *commits*.
A commit is simply an annotated snapshot of a subset of the files in the project.

# Untracking and ignoring files
