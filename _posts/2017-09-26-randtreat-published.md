Today I got my very first ever singleâ€“handedly-written article [published in the Stata Journal](http://www.stata-journal.com/article.html?article=st0490)! The PDF can be found [here]().

An good introduction to the *misfits* problem is provided by Bruhn and McKenzie in their [original blog post](http://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/tools-of-the-trade-doing-stratified-randomization-with-uneven-numbers-in-some-strata). Some time ago I wrote a Stata program -`randtreat`- to address this issue. Be sure to check out the help file for more details on the program.
