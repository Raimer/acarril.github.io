Post about logs.

### Is it that a *natural* logarithm?

Yes it is!

It baffles me that we economists keep saying "take the logarithm of household income" and keep writing $$\log{y}$$, when what we really mean is to take the *natural* logarithm of household income, $$\ln{y}$$. I honestly don't know why this has happened, but in this post (and in general) I will always refer to natural logarithms by their full name and correct notation.

# Is there a reason for preferring natural logarithms in econometrics?

Yes, but the reasons are not extremely strong.

The most commonly cited advantage is that coefficients on the natural-log scale are *directly* interpretable as approximate proportional differences: with a coefficient of 0.07, a difference of 1 in $$x$$ corresponds to an approximate 7% difference in $$y$$ (Gelman and Hill).

Another advantage of natural logs of regular ones is that their first differential is simpler:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\ln x}{\partial x} &= \frac{1}{x} \\
\frac{\log x}{\partial x} &= \frac{1}{x\ln{10}}
\end{align}
$$

The emphasis is on *directly* interpretable, because we could take logarithms in a different base and still get similar results.
