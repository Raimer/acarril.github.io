title: Mathjax test
---

Mathjax seems to render glyphs a little bit larger than the surrounding text.

* **Lowercase letters and symbols seem fine:** a$a$, b$b$, $\pi$, etc.
* **Uppercase letters in mathmode seem too large:** A$A$, B$B$, P$\Pi$, etc.
* **Numbers seem too large:** 1$1$One, 2$2$Two, etc.
