# Welcome to my website!

I'm Alvaro Carril, an economist working as a research analysit at [J-PAL LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lac). In J-PAL I'm involved in projects related to tax policy and procurement, working as research assistant of professors [Dina Pomeranz](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=603214) (Harvard) and [Gabriel Zucman](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/) (UC Berkeley).

My personal interests include development economics, econometrics and computational tools for economics. I have developed several Stata commands, most of which are freely available in my [GitHub Repo](http://www.github.com/acarril) or at the [SSC Archive](https://ideas.repec.org/f/pca1141.html).

## Working papers and work in progress

- "Dealing with misfits in random treatment assignment", Stata Journal (under review)
- "What's the Value of the Teacher? Mechanisms and effects of teacher absenteeism on
student achievement" with Valentina Paredes (in progress)
