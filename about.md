# Welcome to my website!

This site is mainly a personal output channel, useful for writing down ideas I have in mind. As many times those ideas turned out to be useful for others, I thought of making brief, clear blog posts with them. I hope you find something useful.

My work (mainly) consists of performing economic analysis using Stata, R and Python, so most posts revolve around that topic. I'm very passionate about data analysis and computer programs to conduct it, so please feel free contact me if you want to discuss further.

# About me

<img style="float: right; margin-left:0px;" src="..\files\photo_cv.jpg">
I'm Alvaro Carril, an economist and senior research analyst at [J-PAL LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lac). Right now I work mostly  with professor [Christopher Neilson](https://sites.google.com/site/christopherneilson/) (Princeton University), analyzing national-level data of school attendance in the Dominican Republic and implementing machine learning methods to predict school dropout. I also devote part of my time to a project related to tax policy and procurement, with professors [Dina Pomeranz](http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=603214) (Harvard Business School) and [Gabriel Zucman](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/) (UC Berkeley).

I'm interested in development economics, econometrics and computational tools for economics. I have developed several [Stata programs](/resources), all of which are available in my [Git repo](http://www.github.com/acarril) or at the [SSC Archive](https://ideas.repec.org/f/pca1141.html).

You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oow36pf0wyevnc4/CV_acarril.pdf?dl=0).
