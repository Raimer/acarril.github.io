# About
<hr>

This site is mainly a personal output channel, useful for writing down ideas I have in mind. As sometimes those ideas turn out to be useful for others, I thought of making brief, clear blog posts with them. I hope you find something useful.

My work (mainly) consists of performing economic data analysis using Stata, R and Python, so most posts revolve around that topic. I'm very passionate about data analysis and computer programs to conduct it, so feel free contact me if you want to discuss further.

# About me

<img style="float: right; margin-left:20px;" src="../files/photo_cv.jpg">
I am a research assistant at the [NBER](http://www.nber.org/) for professor [Christopher Neilson](https://sites.google.com/site/christopherneilson/).
My current research with professor Neilson is mainly concerned in the determinants of income inequality within college graduates, focusing on the role of observable and unobservable skills and preferences.
Prior to this position I was a senior research assistant at [J-PAL LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lac), where I worked in Chile and in the Dominican Republic. In the latter, I assisted professor Neilson in the analysis of national-level student data in the DR, assessing the impact of a nation-wide policy to help prevent school dropout, and implementing machine learning methods to predict dropout rates, among other projects.

I have also worked with [Sebastián Bustos](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/sebastian-bustos) (Harvard Kennedy School), [Dina Pomeranz](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/pomeranz.html) (University of Zurich) and [Gabriel Zucman](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/) (UC Berkeley) in a project that studies tax evasion of multinational firms operating in Chile, and studies the impact of a set of laws aimed to curb this profit-shifting.

Before joining J-PAL I was a math and physics teacher at [Colegio Antares](http://www.colegioantares.cl/), a small school in the outskirts of Santiago, Chile. I did this as part of Enseña Chile, which is part of [Teach for All](http://teachforall.org/). I still enjoy teaching and continue to do so, either as a TA at Universidad de Chile, as a lecturer at [J-PAL's Impact Evaluation](http://www.educacioncontinua.uc.cl/24718-ficha-diplomado-en-evaluacion-de-impacto-de-programas-y-politicas-publicas) postgraduate program and in several standalone workshops with partners.

I am interested in development economics, economics of education, econometrics and data analysis. I have developed several [Stata, R and Python routines](/resources), all of which are available in my [Git repo](http://www.github.com/acarril). I am also writing a book on data analysis in R.

You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oow36pf0wyevnc4/CV_acarril.pdf?dl=0). My research can be found in the [research](/research) section of this webpage.
