# About
<hr>

This site is mainly a personal output channel, useful for writing down ideas I have in mind. As sometimes those ideas turn out to be useful for others, I thought of making brief, clear blog posts with them. I hope you find something useful.

My work (mainly) consists of performing economic data analysis using Stata, R and Python, so most posts revolve around that topic. I'm very passionate about data analysis and computer programs to conduct it, so feel free contact me if you want to discuss further.

# About me

<img style="float: right; margin-left:20px;" src="../files/photo_cv.jpg">
I'm Alvaro Carril, an economist and senior research analyst at [J-PAL LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lac). I'm currently based in the Dominican Republic, assisting Princeton professor [Christopher Neilson](https://sites.google.com/site/christopherneilson/) in the analysis of national-level student data in the DR, assessing the impact of public policies in school dropout and implementing machine learning methods to predict dropout. I also devote part of my time assisting professors [Sebastián Bustos](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/sebastian-bustos) (Harvard Kennedy School), [Dina Pomeranz](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/pomeranz.html) (University of Zurich) and [Gabriel Zucman](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/) (UC Berkeley) in a project that studies tax evasion of multinational firms operating in Chile.

Before joining J-PAL I was a math and physics teacher at [Colegio Antares](http://www.colegioantares.cl/), a small school in the outskirts of Santiago, Chile. I did this as part of Enseña Chile, which is part of [Teach for All](http://teachforall.org/). I still enjoy teaching and continue to do so, either as a TA at Universidad de Chile, as a lecturer at [J-PAL's Impact Evaluation](http://www.educacioncontinua.uc.cl/24718-ficha-diplomado-en-evaluacion-de-impacto-de-programas-y-politicas-publicas) postgraduate program and in several standalone workshops with partners.

I'm interested in development economics, economics of education, econometrics and data analysis. I have developed several [Stata programs](/resources), all of which are available in my [Git repo](http://www.github.com/acarril) or at the [SSC Archive](https://ideas.repec.org/f/pca1141.html). There are some Python and R routines as well. I'm also writing a book on data analysis in R.
