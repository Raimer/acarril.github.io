# Welcome!

I'm Alvaro Carril, a PhD student at the Economics Department of Princeton University.

My main (research) interests revolve around reducing inequalities and improving the efficiency of markets that are heavily influenced ---or controlled--- by the public sector.
I'm particularly interested in studying the relationship between the education and labor markets.

You can read more about me and find my CV in [About/CV](/about-cv) section of this website.
The [Resources](/resources) section serves as a repository of miscellaneous material that I've worked on over the years, which some people my find useful.
Many of the projects that I'm working on (or not) are hosted on [my Github repo](https://www.github.com/acarril), which also hosts most of the material listed in [Resources](/resources).

## About this site

I like it when researchers take the time to share their knowledge of the computational tools that they use, so this website is (among other things) an attempt to do so myself.
Over the years I've accumulated some expertise on what I call "the tools of the trade", and I find it both constructive and fun to write posts covering specific topics.
I hope you find something useful.
