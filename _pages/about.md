I'm a PhD student at the Economics Department of Princeton University.
My main (research) interests revolve around reducing inequalities and improving the efficiency of markets that are heavily influenced ---or controlled--- by the public sector.
I'm particularly interested in studying the relationship between the education and labor markets.
I have developed several [Stata, R and Python routines](/resources), all of which are available in my [Git repo](http://www.github.com/acarril).
I am also writing a book on data analysis in R.

Previously I was a research fellow at the [NBER](http://www.nber.org/), where I worked with professor [Christopher Neilson](https://christopherneilson.github.io/) in several of his projects.
I also held the same position for two years at [J-PAL LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lac), working with Chris, as well as with professors [Sebastián Bustos](https://growthlab.cid.harvard.edu/people/sebastian-bustos), [Dina Pomeranz](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/pomeranz.html) and [Gabriel Zucman](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/), based in Chile and The Dominican Republic.
Before this, I was a high-school math and physics teacher at [Colegio Antares](http://www.colegioantares.cl/), a small school in the outskirts of Santiago, Chile. I did this as part of [Enseña Chile](https://www.ensenachile.cl/), an NGO that follows the [Teach for All](http://teachforall.org/) model.

You can find my CV [here](/cv).
I've collected much of my work in the [research](/research) and [resources](/resources) sections of this website.
