Currently I'm a research fellow at the [NBER](http://www.nber.org/), working with [Christopher Neilson](https://econphilomath.github.io) (Princeton University and Microsoft Research) in a project that
uses a structural model to integrate quasi-experimental and descriptive evidence ---taken from nearly fifty years of admission records for Chilean universities linked to population tax data--- to study the earnings effects of college and major choice over the life course.

Prior to this position I was an RA at [J-PAL LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lac), based in Chile and in the Dominican Republic.
In the latter, I worked with Chris in assessing the impact of a nation-wide policy to help prevent school dropout, and implementing machine learning methods to predict dropout rates, among other projects.
During my time at J-PAL I also worked with [Sebastián Bustos](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/sebastian-bustos) (Harvard Kennedy School), [Dina Pomeranz](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/pomeranz.html) (University of Zurich) and [Gabriel Zucman](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/) (UC Berkeley) in a project that analyses tax evasion of multinational firms operating in Chile, and studies the impact of a set of laws aimed to curb this profit-shifting.
Before joining J-PAL I was a math and physics teacher at [Colegio Antares](http://www.colegioantares.cl/), a small school in the outskirts of Santiago, Chile. I did this as part of Enseña Chile, which is an NGO that follows the [Teach for All](http://teachforall.org/) model.
<!-- I still enjoy teaching and continue to do so, either as a TA at Universidad de Chile, as a lecturer at [J-PAL's Impact Evaluation](http://www.educacioncontinua.uc.cl/24718-ficha-diplomado-en-evaluacion-de-impacto-de-programas-y-politicas-publicas) postgraduate program and in several standalone workshops with partners. -->

I hold a B.A. degree in economics from Universidad de Chile.
My research interests include development and labor economics with a focus on education and health, as well as econometrics and data analysis. I have developed several [Stata, R and Python routines](/resources), all of which are available in my [Git repo](http://www.github.com/acarril). I am also writing a book on data analysis in R.

You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oow36pf0wyevnc4/CV_acarril.pdf?dl=0).
I've collected much of my work in the [research](/research) and [resources](/resources) sections of this webpage.

# About this site

This site is mainly a personal output channel, useful for writing down ideas I have in mind.
As sometimes those ideas turn out to be useful for others, I thought of making brief, clear blog posts with them.
I hope you find something useful.

My work (mainly) consists on conducting empirical data analysis using Stata, R and Python, so most posts revolve around that theme.
I'm very passionate about data analysis and the tools used to conduct it, so feel free contact me if you want to discuss further.
