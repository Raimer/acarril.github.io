I'm a PhD student at the Economics Department of Princeton University.
My research interests include development and labor economics with a focus on education and health, as well as econometrics and data analysis. I have developed several [Stata, R and Python routines](/resources), all of which are available in my [Git repo](http://www.github.com/acarril). I am also writing a book on data analysis in R.

Previously I was a research fellow at the [NBER](http://www.nber.org/), where I worked with professor [Christopher Neilson](https://econphilomath.github.io) in several of his projects.
I also held the same position for two years at [J-PAL LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lac), working with Chris, as well as with professors [Sebasti치n Bustos](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/sebastian-bustos), [Dina Pomeranz](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/pomeranz.html) and [Gabriel Zucman](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/), based in Chile and The Dominican Republic.
Before this, I was a highschool math and physics teacher at [Colegio Antares](http://www.colegioantares.cl/), a small school in the outskirts of Santiago, Chile. I did this as part of [Ense침a Chile](), an NGO that follows the [Teach for All](http://teachforall.org/) model.

<!-- Currently I'm a research fellow at the [NBER](http://www.nber.org/), working with [Christopher Neilson](https://econphilomath.github.io) (Princeton University and Microsoft Research) in a project that
uses a structural model to integrate quasi-experimental and descriptive evidence ---taken from nearly fifty years of admission records for Chilean universities linked to population tax data--- to study the earnings effects of college and major choice over the life course.

Prior to this position I was an RA at [J-PAL LAC](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/lac), based in Chile and in the Dominican Republic.
In the latter, I worked with Chris in assessing the impact of a nation-wide policy to help prevent school dropout, and implementing machine learning methods to predict dropout rates, among other projects.
During my time at J-PAL I also worked with [Sebasti치n Bustos](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/sebastian-bustos) (Harvard Kennedy School), [Dina Pomeranz](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/pomeranz.html) (University of Zurich) and [Gabriel Zucman](http://gabriel-zucman.eu/) (UC Berkeley) in a project that analyses tax evasion of multinational firms operating in Chile, and studies the impact of a set of laws aimed to curb this profit-shifting.

<!-- I still enjoy teaching and continue to do so, either as a TA at Universidad de Chile, as a lecturer at [J-PAL's Impact Evaluation](http://www.educacioncontinua.uc.cl/24718-ficha-diplomado-en-evaluacion-de-impacto-de-programas-y-politicas-publicas) postgraduate program and in several standalone workshops with partners. -->

# About this site

I'm very passionate about data analysis, and I like it when researchers take the time to share their knowledge of the computational tools that they use.
The [Blog](/) section of this website is an attempt to do so myself.
Over the years I've accumulated some expertise on what I call "the tools of the trade", and I find it useful and fun to write down tidbits of that expertise in concise chunks (i.e. blog posts).
My work (mainly) consists in conducting empirical analysis using Stata, R and Python, so most posts revolve around that theme.
I hope you find something useful.
