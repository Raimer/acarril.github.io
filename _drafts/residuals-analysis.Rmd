Let's use a small, simulated dataset to help us along.

```R
simdata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acarril/NER/master/datos/simdatos.csv")
head(simdata)
ggplot(simdata, aes(x,y)) + geom_points()
```

### Can residuals be normally distributed even if the dependent variable is not?

In short, yes.

For instance, consider a univariate regression problem where $$y \sim \mathcal{N}(\beta x, \sigma^2)$$, so that a lineal model is appropriate. Additionally, suppose $$\beta = 1$$. Under this setup the residuals of the true model are normal, but the distribution of $$y$$ depends on the distribution of $$x$$, because the conditional mean of $$y$$ is a function of $$x$$.

If
