This page is a repository of "resources" of various types, collected in one place. These include [**software**](#software) bits I've written (mostly Stata), [**datasets**](#datasets) and miscellaneous [**documents**](#documents) (mainly in spanish).

# Software

Although I code in R, Matlab and Python, I believe my only worthy collaborations to the world are LaTeX and Stata programs. Here's a list of them:

### Stata programs

All programs can be installed directly within Stata using <code>ssc install <i>program_name</i></code>.

- [**psestimate**](/resources/psestimate) -- Estimate the propensity score proposed by [Imbens and Rubin (2015)](http://www.cambridge.org/zw/academic/subjects/statistics-probability/statistical-theory-and-methods/causal-inference-statistics-social-and-biomedical-sciences-introduction). Available at my [git repo](https://github.com/acarril/psestimate).
- [**randtreat**](/resources/randtreat) -- Random treatment assignment with unequal treatment fractions and dealing with misfits. Available at the [SSC archive](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s458106.html) or at my [git repo](https://github.com/acarril/randtreat).
- **nrow** -- Rename variables as their *n*-th row values. Available at the [SSC archive](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s458116.html) or at my [git repo](https://github.com/acarril/nrow).
