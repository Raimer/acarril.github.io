# Resources

This page is a repository of resources of various types, collected in one place. These include [software](#software) bits I've written (mostly Stata) and miscellaneous [documents](#documents) (mostly in spanish).

### Software

Although I also like to code in R, Matlab and Python, I believe my only worthy collaborations to the world are Stata and LaTeX programs. All Stata programs can be installed directly within Stata using `ssc install <program>`.
